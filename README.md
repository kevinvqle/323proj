# CPSC 323 Project 1 Lexical Analyzer

## Overview
This program is a lexer, which takes an input source code file and tokenizes it into individual tokens. Each token is then categorized into different types, such as keywords, identifiers, integers, real numbers, operators, and separators. 

## Setup
Clone or download this repository to your local machine
```bash
git clone https://github.com/kevinvqle/323proj.git
```
Make sure you have an input source code file (e.g. **input_scode.txt**) in the same directory as the **lexAnalyzer.py** script. You can replace this file with your own source code.

## Usage
1. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where the **lexAnalyzer.py** script is located.
2. Run the lexer by executing the following command. 
```bash
python3 lexAnalyzer.py
```
3. The lexer will process the input source code file and generate an output file named **output.txt**. This file will contain a list of tokens and their corresponding lexemes.
